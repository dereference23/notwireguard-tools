wireguard (1.0.20200206-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  As of wireguard-linux-compat and wireguard-dkms version 0.0.20200215-2,
  we no longer treat installation of the wireguard metapackage as a reason
  to try to reload the kernel module upon upgrade.

  See the discussion on
  https://salsa.debian.org/debian/wireguard-linux-compat/merge_requests/2
  for more details.
